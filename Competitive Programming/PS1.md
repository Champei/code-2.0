# Implementation & Simulation Problems

These problems test your ability to translate a problem's rules directly into code.

- [Team (231A)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/231/A)  
  **Rating:** 800  
  **Topic:** Simple Loop  
  <details><summary>Hint</summary>For each problem, sum the three inputs (0s and 1s). If the sum is 2 or greater, add 1 to your answer.</details>

- [Stones on the Table (266A)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/266/A)  
  **Rating:** 800  
  **Topic:** String Iteration  
  <details><summary>Hint</summary>Iterate through the string from the first to the second-to-last character. Compare each character `s[i]` with the next one `s[i+1]`. If they're the same, increment a counter.</details>

- [Queue at the School (266B)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/266/B)  
  **Rating:** 900  
  **Topic:** Array Simulation  
  <details><summary>Hint</summary>You need to simulate the process `t` times. In each second, iterate through the queue and find all adjacent "BG" pairs to swap. Be careful not to swap a newly moved 'B' again in the same second.</details>

- [Nearly Lucky Number (110A)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/110/A)  
  **Rating:** 800  
  **Topic:** Digit Manipulation  
  <details><summary>Hint</summary>First, count the number of '4's and '7's in the input number. Let this count be `c`. Then, check if `c` itself is a lucky number (i.e., 4 or 7).</details>

- [Two-gram (977B)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/977/B)  
  **Rating:** 900  
  **Topic:** Substring Counting  
  <details><summary>Hint</summary>Iterate through all substrings of length 2. Use a map or dictionary to store the frequency of each two-gram. Then, find the one with the highest count.</details>
