# 🏠 Problem Statement 0A: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

## 🎯 Objective

Build a simple **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices from features like area, number of rooms, and location.

> “Given house details, can we predict its price?”

---

## ⚙️ Core Features

* Load housing dataset (Boston Housing or Kaggle housing prices).
* Preprocess data (handle missing values, normalize features).
* Train a **Linear Regression** model.
* Evaluate using RMSE / R².

## 🚀 Extensions

* Try **Polynomial Regression**.
* Add **regularization** (Ridge/Lasso).
* Compare with a Decision Tree baseline.
* Try coding LR on your own

# 🌳 Problem Statement 0B: Classifying with Decision Trees

## 🎯 Objective

Train a **Decision Tree classifier** to predict categorical outcomes (e.g., student pass/fail, loan approval, or Titanic survival).

> “Given features, can we decide the outcome using splits?”

---

## ⚙️ Core Features

* Load a simple dataset (Titanic, Student Performance).
* Preprocess categorical variables (encode, handle missing data).
* Train a Decision Tree model.
* Visualize the tree (feature splits).

---

## 🚀 Extensions

* Compare Decision Tree with **Random Forest**.
* Tune tree depth and splitting criteria.
* Visualize feature importance.
