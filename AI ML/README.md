# AI/ML

Welcome to the codeˣ repo of the most fascinating domain of them all. How does ChatGPT understand your assignment? how does gemini makes a photo of you in a Bugatti? And why is stockfish unbeatable? The answer to all this is what we refer to as Artificial intelligence. 

Since we are expecting beginners(as in, we don't expect you to know much, except python), so we have compiled a list of resources you can use to break your way into this domain. 

## Resources

- [Kaggle Learn - Courses on the topic](https://www.kaggle.com/learn): Slow but steady
- [3B1B - Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi): First 4 videos are enough. Can continue for interest. 
- [Patrick Loeber - Pytorch](https://youtu.be/c36lUUr864M?si=rGPrz-aWPjTHlYRL): The researcher's favorite framework.
- [Aladdin Persson - TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhyoLH6IjfxVOdVC1P1L5z5azs0XjMsb): Google's own framework
- [Murtaza's Workshop - OpenCV](https://youtu.be/WQeoO7MI0Bs?si=UrVALxkKLFfq0sDM): half of the fancy Computer Vision projects you see on the internet.
- [CS 229](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&feature=shared), [CS 230](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOABXSygHTsbvUz4G_YQhOb&feature=shared), [CS 231](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv&feature=shared): Stanford Courses; Beloved.
- [CampusX - 100 days of Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvbr7zKYQuBfsVkjoLcJgxHH&si=gNvEs14B5n-UXJOm): More oriented towards classical ML. Completely optional but handy. 
- [CampusX - 100 days of Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvYuZauWaPlRTC54KxSNLtNn): Highly detailed, but long. Again optional.

Yes, there really is no end. 

"There must be some other way to learn than just endless cycle of videos?" 

Well, there is...

## PS

**Note:** The repo for this domain has been structured differently compared to others. This is because we do not intend to force a particular progression ladder on you. Select and try the PS you find interesting(and won't be overwhelmed with), and feel free to ask for more help and/or resources. All of us have been where you are currently, so nothing's unconquerable. 

Well, without further ado...

### Beginner
> Python hi aata hai..
---
1. 🔢 [Problem Statement: MNIST Image Classification](MNIST.md)

Build an **Image Classification System** in Python that can recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.
The system leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to answer:

> “Given an image, what digit does it represent?”

2. 🔍 [Problem Statement: Dataset Analysis Project](dataset_analysis.md)

You have to explore and analyze a dataset to extract insights, build predictive models (if relevant), and communicate findings clearly. Emphasis is on thorough analysis + reproducibility + presentation.

### Intermediate

> Previous ones were too simple

1. 💬 [Problem Statement: RAG-Powered Chatbot with a Special Feature](RAG.md)

Build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** in Python that can answer questions by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base and generating natural, contextual responses.

Unlike a generic RAG chatbot, this project requires a **special feature** that enhances usability or intelligence.

> “Don’t just retrieve and generate — do something extra that makes this chatbot stand out.”


2. 🎬 [Problem Statement: Content-Based Movie Recommendation System](Rec_system.md)

Build a Content-Based Movie Recommendation Engine in Python that suggests movies similar to a given title based on genre, plot, cast, and crew.  
The system leverages text processing and similarity measures to answer:  
> “If you liked movie X, you may also like movie Y.”


TODO
### Advanced
 > For those who dare
---
1. 🧑‍⚕️ [Problem Statement: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis for a Virtual Counsellor](Sentiment_analysis.md)

Build an AI-powered **virtual counsellor** that can analyze both **text** (what someone says) and **video** (how they express it) to detect sentiment and emotions. The system leverages multimodal learning to answer:

> “What is this person *really* feeling, based on both their words and expressions?”


2. 🎲 [Problem Statement: AI Dungeon Master Chatbot for Dungeons & Dragons](DnD.md)

Build an AI-powered **Dungeon Master (DM) agent** that runs a Dungeons & Dragons (D\&D 5e-inspired) campaign, handling story narration, dice rolls, combat, and player interactions. The DM dynamically generates scenarios, describes environments, enforces rules, and coordinates Non-Player Character (NPC) agents.
