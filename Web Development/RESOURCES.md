# Web Development – Resources & Fundamentals

Start with a basic understanding of the following fundamentals. You can polish them further while working on projects.

## Basic Concepts to Learn Before Starting

Start with a basic understanding of the following fundamentals. You can polish them further while working on projects.

### HTML
- Learn HTML tags, semantics, and page structure.
- Connecting files CSS and JS properly.

### CSS
- Flexbox, Grid, Styling basics, Responsive design.

### JavaScript Advanced Concepts
- Asynchronous JS (Promises, async/await)  
- Fetch APIs / Axios  
- LocalStorage, SessionStorage  
- Cookies, Tokens, bcrypt  

### Frontend Frameworks
- React.js / Angular / Vue.js  
  We recommend React as it’s widely used in college projects. You can explore Next.js later.  
- Learn TailwindCSS for faster styling or SASS for more control.

For AI or Python-based web apps, frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, or Django are useful. But even if you start with JS ecosystem, you may switch easily later.

### Backend Basics
- Node.js + Express.js  
- RESTful API Design  
- CRUD Operations  
- Middleware Concepts  

### Authentication & Security
- JWT / OAuth2  
- Password Hashing (bcrypt)  
- HTTPS Basics  

### Databases
Learn enough to **use databases effectively**. No need to implement PostgreSQL from scratch.

- MongoDB generally integrates well with Node.js (install MongoDB Compass)  
- PostgreSQL is better for strict data constraints (install PgAdmin)  

### WebSockets & Realtime
- WebSocket API  
- Socket.IO  

### Networking Basics
- HTTP / HTTPS Protocols  
- TCP / UDP Basics  
- WebRTC Basics (STUN/TURN servers)  

### Version Control
- Git (Branching, Pull Requests, Merging, Forking, Commenting)  
PS: Fork a repository from an organization like GSOC (Google Summer of Code) and explore.

### Advanced Topics
After learning the basics, explore:
- TypeScript and Redis (production-grade code)  
- Docker and SSH (team collaboration, deployment)  
- Search services like Meilisearch on Docker  
- Security Practices: XSS, CSRF prevention  
- Deployment: Docker / Kubernetes / CI/CD  
- Performance Optimizations: Code Splitting, Caching  
- Testing: Jest, Mocha, Playwright, React Testing Library
