## Frontend Frameworks
- **React.js / Angular / Vue.js**  
  We recommend **React** as it’s widely used in college projects. You can explore Next.js later.  
- Learn **TailwindCSS** for faster styling or **SASS** for more control.

For AI or Python-based web apps, frameworks like **Flask, FastAPI, or Django** are useful. But even if you start with JS ecosystem, you may switch easily later.
