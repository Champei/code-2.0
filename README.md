## Welcome

**codeˣ 2.0** is designed as the primary launchpad into Computer Science for first-year CSE students.  
This repository helps you build strong foundational skills while exploring various domains of technology.   

---

## Objectives

- Develop problem-solving skills useful for interviews and competitive programming  
- Provide structured paths for exploring modern computer science domains  
- Encourage project-based learning  
- Motivate students to participate in hackathons, clubs, and research activities  

---

## Getting Started

We recommend the following progression:  

### Phase 0 – Prerequisite Basics  
Before starting codeˣ 2.0, review [TechSoC 2025](https://github.com/YashBhamare123/TechSoC-25).  

That repository covers:  
- Environment setup  
- Git and GitHub basics  
- Introductory coding challenges  

This phase is essential if you are new to programming or development tools.  

### Phase 1 – Competitive Programming  
- Every student is expected to begin with competitive programming.  
- It develops logical thinking, efficiency, and problem-solving skills required for placements and technical assessments.  
- Start here: [Competitive Programming](./Competitive%20Programming/README.md).  

### Phase 2 – Domain Exploration  
After CP basics, you may choose one or more domains:  
- [Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning](./AI%20ML/README.md)  
- [App Development](./App%20Development/README.md)  
- [Blockchain](./Blockchain/README.md)  
- [Cybersecurity](./Cybersecurity/README.md)  
- [Game Development](./Graphics%20Programming/README.md)  
- [Quantum Computing](./Quantum%20Computing/README.md)  
- [Web Development](./Web%20Development/README.md)  

Each domain contains:  
- `README.md` – brief introduction and roadmap  
- `RESOURCES.md` – curated references and tutorials  
- `PS.md` – individual problem statements and projects

## Deadlines and Pace

Deadlines are provided to encourage consistency.  
They are not strict examinations but checkpoints to keep progress on track.  

If you cannot complete tasks on time, you can revisit them later. The repository will remain a useful reference throughout your academic journey.

## Usage Guide

1. If you are a beginner, start with [TechSoC-25](https://github.com/YashBhamare123/TechSoC-25) for setup and basic coding practice. Also various [resources](https://github.com/YashBhamare123/TechSoC-25/blob/main/RESOURCES.md) about basic programming are provided by TechSoC too. 
2. Begin with **Competitive Programming** to strengthen logic and problem-solving skills.  
3. Select a domain of interest.  
4. Follow the domain structure:  
   - `README.md` – overview and roadmap  
   - `RESOURCES.md` – learn core concepts and tools  
   - `PS.md` – solve problem statements/projects sequentially  
5. Track and share your progress with peers, discuss approaches, and learn collaboratively.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary><strong>I am a complete beginner. Where should I start?</strong></summary>

Start with [TechSoC-25](https://github.com/TechSoc-25) for environment setup and basic concepts.  
Then proceed to Competitive Programming in this repository.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Which programming language should I use?</strong></summary>

C++ is recommended for CP and interviews.  
However, any programming language may be used depending on domain.  
The emphasis is on problem-solving rather than syntax.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are deadlines strict?</strong></summary>

Deadlines exist to help maintain discipline but are not mandatory.  
They serve as checkpoints to guide progress, not as examinations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to complete all domains?</strong></summary>

No. Competitive Programming is mandatory.  
After that, you may choose domains according to your interests.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What should I do if I get stuck?</strong></summary>

1. Revisit the `RESOURCES.md` file for the relevant domain  
2. Search online using Google or StackOverflow  
3. Break the problem into smaller subproblems  
4. Discuss with peers or seniors

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What will I gain by completing this?</strong></summary>

By the end of this program, you will have:  

- Strong CP foundations  
- Hands-on project experience  
- Preparation for interviews, hackathons, and club activities  
- A portfolio of solved problems and projects
